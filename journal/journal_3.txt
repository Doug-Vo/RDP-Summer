My mum’s 70th birthday. It felt bleak to be in hospital on such a significant day for her.
My new friends distracted me. Undoubtedly, a crew is forming.
At the end of the night, M gave me a hug and I feel already deeply bonded. A powerful force.

Four sets of visitors, a brief, underwhelming visit down the street and read my book about the child killer Mary Bell.
Wishing to be with M. Am I already smitten with idealization?
I came back from down the street feeling a void. I wanted to see M again but had no idea where to find him.
And that is how I spent the day of my mum’s 70th birthday party.

I woke at 4 a.m. with the feeling of being abandoned by my family.
Feeling left out of Mum’s 70th party. No family had yet visited me in hospital (though most interstate).
Less worthy of attention and care because I am partnerless, family-less, childless and once again in a mental hospital just like my deceased aunt, the former bipolar black sheep of the family.
Am I now to take over that mantle? Am I too difficult? Am I selfish, abrasive, vindictive and divisive?
The anger, hurt and abandonment festered. I fired off four lengthy messages to Mum at 5:56 a.m.
