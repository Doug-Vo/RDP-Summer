Admissions. Overwhelmed and the realization that this was how low I had sunk.
I was back here again. At night I could not sleep til after midnight.
Foreign bed. Foreign clinic. Familiar feeling of failure.


Woken up before 7 and back into the familiar hospital drill of shower, breakfast and walk.
Almost exactly the same as my previous Sydney hospital.
I still haven’t connected with any fellow patients; hesitant to do so before I’ve settled and knowing how fast and deeply I connect.
Instead I focused on my therapy group sessions.
