Today has been nothing short of a complete disaster. I woke up to pouring rain in a city I don't even want to be in. 
Paris, it seems, is determined to keep up its gloomy weather streak. 
My frustration grew as I navigated through the crowded, chaotic streets, all the while getting soaked to the bone.

To make matters worse, the driver for today's journey was an absolute nightmare. 
They were rude and unprofessional, making the already miserable day even more unbearable. 
I can't help but wonder if I'm the target of some cosmic joke, forced to endure one disappointment after another.

As I reflect on the challenges of this trip, I can't help but feel anger building up inside me. 
Anger at the circumstances, at the driver, and at the relentless rain, or just me being angry at myself.
But despite it all, I remind myself that life has its ups and downs, and this is just a particularly low moment.
I hold on to the hope that things will improve, even if right now, it's difficult to see past the anger and disappointment,
especially when I am exhausted of this prolonged pain.
